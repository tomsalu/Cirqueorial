# Cirqueorial

Repository for my university dissertation in 2013.

Cirqueorial is designed as a tutorial app for iPhones. It allows users to browse and explore a variety of tricks in order to improve their skills. Tutorials contain both video and text tutorials for a given trick, as well as difficulty ratings rated by the community.

The app also has social elements, allowing users to register via facebook and keep track of a personal profile which includes completed tricks, and a XP level to challenge friends.

The app is currently unsupported in the latest versions of iOS, but I am in the process of updating in Swift as a personal project.
